 Purpose

This page outlines how the GAIL team collaborates day-to-day. It includes our ways of working in JIRA, how we hand over work between disciplines (design, dev, test) and a schedule of our regular meetings in sprint.



  Ways of Working (Jira Process)

Proposed method of an idea moving from design - done:

Design ticketing

Each new feature or topic will start with a design task ticket to investigate and explore a potential new area for development. 

These tickets will include user needs/wireframes/user journeys etc

Once the design is completed and signed off by the team and the PO, then the ticket is linked to a related dev ticket which will be created

Development ticketing

A new development story will be created (after the design if required). The BA will write the new story in collaboration with the tech team (and design presence) to attach the signed off designs, acceptance criteria and any dependencies

Once the ticket has been refined and meets the definition of ready, the ticket is ready to be prioritised to go into sprint

Once development has been completed, the ticket moves to ‘ready for QA’ on the board to be tested

QA process of dev tickets

Development tickets will move across the board into QA. QA will then review the ‘ready for QA’ items, validate against the acceptance criteria and log any bugs or issues

Once tested successfully, the ticket will move to done.
